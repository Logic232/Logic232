- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Logic232

ðŸŒ€Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.Never underestimate the determination of someone who is time-rich.

ðŸŒ€I love programming a lot ,and i'm looking forward to learn other programming languages.Which i know is going to be a great experience for me though.
